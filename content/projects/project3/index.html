<pre class="r"><code># Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list &lt;- c(&quot;United States&quot;,&quot;India&quot;, &quot;Germany&quot;)

US_India_Germany_GDP &lt;- clean_GDP_Data%&gt;%
  group_by(year)%&gt;%
  select(Country, IndicatorName, year, Expenditure)%&gt;%
  filter(Country %in% c(&quot;United States&quot;,&quot;India&quot;,&quot;Germany&quot;))%&gt;%
  filter(IndicatorName %in% c(&quot;Gross Capital Formation&quot;, &quot;Exports&quot;,&quot;Gov Consumption&quot;, &quot;Household Consumption&quot;, &quot;Imports&quot; ))


ggplot(US_India_Germany_GDP, aes(year, Expenditure, colour = IndicatorName, group = IndicatorName)) + geom_line() + labs (title = &quot;GDP components over time&quot;, subtitle = &quot;In constant 2010 USD&quot;, y = &quot;Billions US$&quot;, x = &quot;&quot;) + theme_bw(base_size = 10) + scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010)) + facet_wrap(~Country) + guides(color=guide_legend(&quot;Components of GDP&quot;)) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6))</code></pre>
