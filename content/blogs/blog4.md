Thanks for checking out my webpage!

I was born and raised in Canada and I studied business and finance in my undergraduate degree. I enjoy playing sports in my spare time including; football, rugby, soccer and basketball. I have played competitively throughout most of my life.

Currently, I am studying at London Business School in the Masters in Financial Analysis program. I have the hopes of pursuing a career in Corporate Finance & Advisory after I complete my studies.
